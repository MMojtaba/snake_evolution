# Info

This project was made for Dr. Michael D. Adams' SENG 475 course at UVic.  
This Virtual Machine Disk that contains the tools to run this application can be found at: https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/cppbook/#vm_disk_images.  
OpenGL 2.1 and GLSL 1.2 were used, due to the limitation of the school's lab machines.
